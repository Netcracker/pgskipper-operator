  ## Default data collection interval for all inputs

  round_interval = true

  ## Telegraf will send metrics to outputs in batches of at
  ## most metric_batch_size metrics.
  # metric_batch_size = 1000
  ## For failed writes, telegraf will cache metric_buffer_limit metrics for each
  ## output, and will flush this buffer on a successful write. Oldest metrics
  ## are dropped first when this buffer fills.
  # metric_buffer_limit = 10000

  ## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.
  ## Each plugin will sleep for a random time within jitter before collecting.
  ## This can be used to avoid many plugins querying things like sysfs at the
  ## same time, which can have a measurable effect on the system.
  # collection_jitter = "0s"

  ## Default flushing interval for all outputs. You shouldn't set this below
  ## interval. Maximum flush_interval will be flush_interval + flush_jitter
  flush_interval = "60s"
  ## Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid
  ## large write spikes for users running a large number of telegraf instances.
  ## ie, a jitter of 5s and interval 10s means flushes will happen every 10-15s
  # flush_jitter = "0s"

  ## Metric version controls the mapping from Telegraf metrics into
  ## Prometheus format.  When using the prometheus input, use the same value in
  ## both plugins to ensure metrics are round-tripped without modification.
  ##
  ##   example: metric_version = 1; deprecated in 1.13
  ##            metric_version = 2; recommended version
  # metric_version = 1

  ## Use HTTP Basic Authentication.
  # basic_username = "Foo"

  ## Collectors to enable, valid entries are "gocollector" and "process".
  ## If unset, both are enabled.

  ## Send string metrics as Prometheus labels.
  ## Unless set to false all string metrics will be sent as labels.
  # string_as_label = true

  ## If set, enable TLS with the given certificate.
  # tls_cert = "/etc/ssl/telegraf.crt"
  # tls_key = "/etc/ssl/telegraf.key"
